            <h3>Agiasos village</h3>
                <p>The green mountain village of Agiasos is a picturesque, traditional community with cobblestone leafy alleys, old style cafes and historic buildings.
                   It has been described as the "small Switzerland" of Greece because of its immaculate clean streets, musical population and the wood and ceramic
                   artefact tradition. 
                   <br> Make sure you enjoy some ouzo and greek meze at one of the local cafés, and visit the local shops that sell hand made art. 
                   It is a small town and a former municipality on the island of Lesbos, North Aegean, 
                   <br> Greece.  
                   It is located at the slopes of mount Olympos, at a height of 475 meters (1,558 ft), 26 kilometers (16 mi) from Mytilene. It is known for its special 
                   bright green landscape, its narrow cobbled 
                   streets lined by ranks of tiled-roof houses, the traditional architecture and its restless and religious inhabitants. 
                   <br> Agiasos, the artistic and religious centre of the island, is a preserved settlement that has many to offer to visitors. The reading society of 
                   Anaptixi, a famous cultural institution, 
                   was established in 1894, when the village was still under Turkish rule. Today it has a great library, a theatre hall, a folklore museum and an active 
                   organization which tries to continue the traditions that were passed by the old inhabitants.</p>

            <h3>Molyvos castle</h3> <!-----------extracted from https://www.aegeanvacation.com/molivos-castle ---------------------->
                <p>For centuries, the Castle of Molyvos has been gracing the town’s signature medieval splendor with its imposing size, its structure that, for centuries,
                has withstood the passage of time, and strong walls of red and brown stone. While the exact date of its construction is yet to be pinpointed, the Castle of Molyvos 
                remains one of the best-preserved, and best-loved, attractions in the Eastern Mediterranean.
                The Castle of Molyvos has changed hands any number of times, each of its series of occupants making renovations or additions to the original structure. The Castle 
                of red and brown trachyte passed to the line of the Gateluzzi in the 14th century AD, when a first phase of renovations took place. It was then renovated once more 
                in the course of the Ottoman occupation of Lesvos (between 1462 and 1912) and it is believed that the last series of renovations ended in the 18th century AD. While 
                it is unknown exactly when the original structure was constructed, historians speculate that the Castle was built in the 13th century, primarily to protect the 
                population within from the many invaders determined to occupy Molyvos city.</p>

            <h3>Mytilene architecture</h3>  <!------------------------------Extracted from www.greeka.com------------------->
                <p>Similar to its neighbouring Greek islands, the architecture of Lesvos is characterized by its unique elegance, traditional quality and rich culture. Most of 
                the island villages which are built amphitheatrically on the mountain slopes retain their long-established character that is mostly apparent in its architecture. 
                At first sight, a visitor is charmed by the beautiful mansions, towers, the stone school buildings, traditional windmills and the monasteries, all these that compose 
                the unique architectural style of Lesvos island, an interesting mixture of local, eastern and western characteristics. The urban houses were built with local stone 
                with tiled roofs and a wooden construction called sachnisi that extends at the second floor of the house, for saving of space. Many interesting public buildings were 
                constructed and survive till today, such as the Girls School in Mytilene, completed in 1899. Today, only few constructions of this type survive. Source: www.greeka.com</p>
